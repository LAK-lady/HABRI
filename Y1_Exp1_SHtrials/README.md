# Overview
This folder services as the public repository for the manuscript by Knose et al. titled "Impact of terrestrial dissolved organic matter on cyanobacteria density and toxin production," submitted for publication in _Harmful Algae_ in August 2024.

# Authorship
This repository was generated and maintained by Lauren Knose, PhD through an ORISE appointment with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. All code was written using R software (version 4.4.1). 

# Contents
This repository contains the original data and processing code for the Year 1, Experiment 1 (SuperHume trials). Files included:

- HABRI_Y1_Exp1_analysis.Rmd - the R code used to process and analyze data from all experiments
- (subfolder) Products - includes the printouts of tables, figures, and supplemental tables and figures referred to in the manuscript. The data workflow is also provided as a knitted html file.
- (subfolder) Original_data - includes the original data from the experiments

# Background
The purpose of these experiments were to quantify the cyanobacteria response to added dissolved organic matter from the terrestrial environment (tDOM) in the presence and absence of nutrient additions. We used seven-day laboratory bottle experiments (1 L) and manipulated tDOM added vs not added, the ratio of added nutrients, as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) at high N:P vs low N:P, and the N form, as NH4Cl vs urea. The response variables were microcystin concentration (ug/L), phycocyanin concentration (PC, ug/L), and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla, ug/L). We used water from three different source waters (Maumee Bay, Sandusky Bay, and Grand Lake, Ohio) to observe cyanobacteria responses across varying background conditions (e.g., phytoplankton community composition, trophic status, and water transparency). Other measured variables were concentrations of total N, total P, DOC, NH4, NO3, and soluble reactive P (PO4-P). The design of the study includes pre-measurements (initials) from the original source water and post-measurements (final) at the conclusion of the experiments. There were 10 treatments with three replicates each (n=90).
