# Overview

This repository serves houses the data, processing code, and products related to the Harmful Algal Bloom Research Initiative (HABRI) grant for the proposal "Evaluating the interactive effects of terrestrial dissolved organic matter and nutrients on cyanobacteria and toxins," awarded to Miami University July 6, 2021, by th eOhio Sea Grant College Program. The project period was 7/1/2021 to 6/31/2024. This project is part of the Ohio Department of Higher Education (ODHE) HABRI FY20/21 funding cycle. 

The work contained herein is divided into three experimental groups, including two rounds of laboratory bottle experiments, which occurred in the first year of funding (Y1 Experiment 1 SuperHume trials and Y1 Experiment 2 tDOM source trials), and a third round of experiments which occurred in the second year of funding using the large Mesocosms at the Miami University Ecological Research Center. 

# Authorship

This repository was generated and maintained by Lauren Knose, PhD through an ORISE appointment with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. All code was written using R software (version 4.4.1). All inquiries about this work should be direct to Dr. Knose.

# Funding

Funding for this work was provided through a matching grant from the Ohio Department of Higher Education (ODHE) Harmful Algal Bloom Research Initiative (HABRI) and Miami University. This research was supported by appointment of Dr. Lauren A. Knose to the Research Participation Program at the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Research and Development, administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) through an Interagency Agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. EPA (92431601).
